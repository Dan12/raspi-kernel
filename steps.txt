===============
Getting Started
===============
1) Download gcc-arm-none-eabi cross compiler from developer.arm.com
2) Download qemu-system-arm for quick testing purposes
3) Copy code from OSdev page on raspberry pi barebones
4) Put their build instructions in makefile


================================
Understanding the barebones code
================================
1) boot.S
    a) _start is where control is handed off from the bootloader to the kernel
    b) It sets up the stack pointer
    c) Sets up the BSS segment (C global veriables)
        i)   __bss_start and __bss_end are defined in the linker script
        ii)  label 1 stores 16 bytes of zeros at a time into the bss segment
        iii) label 2 loops this operation until the whole BSS segment is zeroed
    d) Jumps to the kernel_main function

2) kernel.c
    a) UART is a hardware thing in the raspi cpu. It will let us do IO
        i)   It is "memory mapped", so all interactions go through memory.  The memory segment we will interact with starts at some hardcoded magic number
        ii)  We interact through registers, which are fixed offsets from the base of the UART memory
        iii) For now, we only care about the data register (UART0_DR) and the flags register (UART0+FR).  Flags tells us when we can send and recieve data, and data is where we put data to send and read data to recieve
        iv)  flags at offset 4 tells whether or not uart has data to read, 5 tells whether uart can accpt data from a write

3) linker.ld
    a) Defines the memory layout of our kernel
    b) ENTRY(_start) is what tells the linker our _start label in boot.S is the entry point
    c) The script starts the memory layout at 0x8000, where the bootloader will put the kernel image
    d) It delcares the .text section, the executable code, with .text.boot from boot.S first, then the rest of the kernel code in .text
    e) It declares .rodata (constant data, write protected), .data (initialized data) and .bss (uninitialized data)
    f) Each section is aligned (rounded up) to the nearest 4096, so it fits neatly inside a memory page


========
Building
========
1) Compiling boot.S
    a) -mcpu = cortex-a7: declare the exact model of arm cpu that is being targeted.  Note that this should be "arm1176jzf-s" if compiling for raspi version 1
    b) -fpic: generate position independent code. idk why its needed? maybe try removing?
    c) -ffreestanding: Use standard C includes like stdint.h, but not standard library functions

2) Compiling kernel.c
    a) Similar options, nothing crazy

3) Linking into an image
    a) -T linker.ld: Specify our linker script to do the linking for our kernel
    b) -nostdlib: again, we don't have libc here, so we don't want the compiler to assume we do

4) Running
    a) qemu can emulate rpi2
    b) to run on real hardware, its a bit of a hassle.  easiest to just take an sd card image of an OS that works, and replace kernel.img with ours
